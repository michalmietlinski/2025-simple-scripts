# Development Plan: JSON-Based AI Image Generator

## Project Overview

A TypeScript-based tool for generating images using multiple AI image generation services (DALL-E 3, Midjourney, Stable Diffusion) based on JSON configuration files. The tool will support variable substitution in prompts, batch processing, and comprehensive output management.

## Core Features

### 1. JSON Configuration System
- Fully commented configuration files with all available options
- Support for global defaults and per-image overrides
- Variable substitution in prompts with support for arrays of values
- Validation of configuration files before processing

### 2. Multi-Provider Support
- DALL-E 3 integration (initial focus)
- Midjourney API integration
- Stable Diffusion API integration
- Abstraction layer to handle provider-specific parameters
- Comprehensive guides for each provider's unique features

### 3. Batch Processing
- Rate limiting to manage API costs
- Configurable concurrency settings
- Retry mechanisms for failed requests with exponential backoff
- Progress tracking with persistent state
- Resumable batches after interruption
- Cost estimation before generation starts

### 4. Output Management
- Organized folder structure (by date, batch, or category)
- Metadata storage (JSON file with prompt, parameters, timestamp)
- Consistent naming conventions with variable substitution
- Option to deduplicate similar images

### 5. User Experience
- Real-time progress updates in console
- Detailed logging of operations
- Clear error messages with troubleshooting guidance

### 6. Extensibility
- Custom post-processing scripts support
- Plugin architecture for adding new providers
- Event hooks for integration with other systems

## Technical Architecture

### Core Components

1. **ConfigParser**: Reads and validates JSON configuration files
2. **TemplateEngine**: Handles variable substitution in prompts
3. **ProviderManager**: Abstracts different AI image generation services
4. **BatchProcessor**: Manages the generation queue with rate limiting
5. **OutputManager**: Handles saving images and metadata
6. **CostEstimator**: Calculates estimated API costs before running
7. **ProgressTracker**: Maintains state for resumable operations
8. **PostProcessor**: Applies custom scripts to generated images

### Data Flow

1. Parse and validate configuration file
2. Expand templates into individual generation tasks
3. Estimate total cost and request confirmation
4. Process tasks with rate limiting and retries
5. Save images and metadata in organized structure
6. Apply any post-processing scripts
7. Generate summary report
