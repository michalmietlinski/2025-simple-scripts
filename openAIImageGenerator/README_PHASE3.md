# DALL-E Image Generator - Phase 3: Database Implementation

This document provides an overview of the database implementation for the DALL-E Image Generator application.

## Overview

Phase 3 adds database functionality to the application, allowing it to:

- Store and retrieve prompt history
- Record image generation details
- Track usage statistics
- Manage template variables for batch generation
- Support batch generation jobs

## Database Structure

The application uses SQLite for data storage with the following tables:

1. **prompt_history**: Stores prompts used for image generation
   - Tracks creation date, last used date, usage count, and favorites
   - Supports tagging and template functionality

2. **template_variables**: Stores variable definitions for template prompts
   - Manages variable names and possible values
   - Tracks usage statistics

3. **batch_generations**: Manages batch generation jobs
   - Links to template prompts
   - Tracks progress and status of batch jobs

4. **generation_history**: Records details of generated images
   - Stores image paths, generation parameters, and costs
   - Links to prompts and batch jobs

5. **usage_stats**: Tracks token usage and costs
   - Aggregates daily usage statistics
   - Provides historical usage data

## Key Components

### DatabaseManager

The `DatabaseManager` class in `utils/database_manager.py` provides a comprehensive API for database operations:

- Connection management
- Table creation and schema management
- CRUD operations for all database entities
- Usage statistics tracking

### Data Models

The `utils/data_models.py` module defines classes for all database entities:

- `Prompt`: Represents prompt history entries
- `TemplateVariable`: Manages template variable definitions
- `BatchGeneration`: Tracks batch generation jobs
- `Generation`: Records image generation details
- `UsageStat`: Tracks usage statistics

## UI Integration

The application's UI has been enhanced with:

- Prompt history tab with search and favorite functionality
- Generation history tab with image preview and reuse options
- Support for template-based generation

## Verification

The database implementation can be verified using:

```bash
python -m verification.verify_phase3
```

This script checks:
- Database structure
- Data model functionality
- Database operations
- Application integration

## Next Steps

With the database implementation complete, the application is ready for:

- Advanced prompt management features
- Batch generation functionality
- Usage statistics visualization
- Template-based generation workflows
