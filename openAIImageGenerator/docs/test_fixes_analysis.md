# Analysis of Test Fixes and Database Schema Issues

## Problem Identification

During our recent work on fixing test failures, we encountered a critical issue that broke the application in production. The error was:

```
Failed to get usage statistics: no such column: total_tokens
```

## Root Cause Analysis

1. **Table Name Mismatch**: 
   - In the code, we were referencing a table called `usage_statistics` 
   - However, in some parts of the codebase, the table was called `usage_stats`

2. **Column Name Inconsistency**:
   - The database schema in `src/core/database.py` creates a table called `usage_statistics`
   - The `UsageTracker` class in `src/utils/usage_tracker.py` expects this table to exist
   - However, when we fixed the tests, we focused only on the immediate test failures without checking for broader impacts

3. **Test vs. Production Environment**:
   - Our tests were using an in-memory database (`:memory:`) which was created fresh for each test
   - The production application was using a persistent database file
   - When we deleted and recreated the database file, the schema was created correctly, but we didn't account for users with existing databases

## Impact

1. The application crashed when users tried to view usage statistics
2. The error occurred because the code was trying to query a column that didn't exist in the user's database

## Lessons Learned

1. **Schema Changes Require Migration**: Any change to database schema requires a migration strategy for existing users
2. **Consistent Naming**: Table and column names should be consistent throughout the codebase
3. **Test Environment Differences**: Tests using in-memory databases don't fully represent production environments with persistent storage
4. **Broader Impact Analysis**: When fixing specific issues, we need to consider the broader impact on the system

## Recommended Procedure for Future Database Changes

1. **Schema Version Tracking**:
   - Add a version table to the database to track schema versions
   - Implement a migration system to upgrade schemas between versions

2. **Pre-Implementation Checklist**:
   - [ ] Document all places in the codebase that reference the affected tables/columns
   - [ ] Create a comprehensive test plan that includes both new and existing functionality
   - [ ] Design a migration strategy for existing users
   - [ ] Consider backward compatibility requirements

3. **Implementation Process**:
   - Create database migration scripts
   - Update schema creation code
   - Update all references to the changed schema
   - Add tests specifically for migration scenarios

4. **Testing Strategy**:
   - Test with both new (empty) databases and existing databases
   - Include tests for the migration process
   - Test the application with production-like data volumes

5. **Deployment Plan**:
   - Include clear instructions for users on how to upgrade
   - Consider automatic migration on startup
   - Have a rollback strategy in case of issues

## Specific Fix for Current Issue

To fix the current issue with the `usage_statistics` vs `usage_stats` table name mismatch:

1. Add a database migration function that:
   - Checks if `usage_stats` table exists
   - If it exists, creates a new `usage_statistics` table with the correct schema
   - Copies data from `usage_stats` to `usage_statistics`
   - Drops the old table after successful migration

2. Update all code to consistently use the same table name

3. Add a schema version check on application startup to ensure the database is compatible

## Conclusion

Database schema changes require careful planning and consideration of existing users. By implementing a proper migration system and following a structured process for schema changes, we can avoid similar issues in the future.
