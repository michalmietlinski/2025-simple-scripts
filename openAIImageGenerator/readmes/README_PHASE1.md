# DALL-E Image Generator - Phase 1: Project Setup

This document provides an overview of Phase 1 of the DALL-E Image Generator application, which focuses on project setup and initial implementation.

## Overview

Phase 1 establishes the foundation for the DALL-E Image Generator application, including:

- Project structure and organization
- Configuration management
- API key handling
- Utility modules for file management and usage tracking
- Basic application framework

## Project Structure

The application is organized into the following directories:

- `utils/`: Utility modules for various functionality
- `outputs/`: Directory for storing generated images
- `data/`: Directory for application data (database, logs, etc.)
- `verification/`: Scripts for verifying implementation phases

## Key Components

### Configuration Management

The `config.py` module provides:

- Application configuration settings
- OpenAI API configuration
- Directory management
- Environment variable handling

### API Key Management

The application includes:

- Secure storage of the OpenAI API key in a `.env` file
- UI dialog for entering and testing the API key
- Validation of the API key before use

### Utility Modules

#### File Manager

The `FileManager` class in `utils/file_manager.py`:

- Creates organized directory structures for output files
- Generates unique filenames based on prompts and timestamps
- Handles file saving operations with error handling

#### Usage Tracker

The `UsageTracker` class in `utils/usage_tracker.py`:

- Records token usage for API calls
- Tracks costs associated with image generation
- Provides usage statistics

## Application Framework

The main application (`app.py`):

- Implements a Tkinter-based GUI
- Provides API key management interface
- Sets up the basic application structure
- Includes verification functionality

## Verification

The Phase 1 implementation can be verified using:

```bash
python -m verification.verify_phase1
```

This script checks:
- Project structure
- Configuration loading
- API key management
- Utility module functionality

## Next Steps

With the foundation established in Phase 1, the application is ready for:

- Integration with the OpenAI API (Phase 2)
- Implementation of image generation functionality
- Development of the user interface for image generation
