# DALL-E Image Generator - Phase 3: Database Implementation

This document provides an overview of Phase 3 of the DALL-E Image Generator application, which focuses on database implementation for storing prompts, generations, and usage statistics.

## Overview

Phase 3 implements a database system to track and manage:

- User prompts and their history
- Generated images and their metadata
- Template variables for dynamic prompt generation
- Batch processing capabilities
- Usage statistics for monitoring API consumption

## Database Design

The application uses SQLite for data storage, with the following key tables:

- **prompts**: Stores user prompts with timestamps and favorite status
- **template_variables**: Stores variables that can be used in prompt templates
- **generations**: Records details of generated images including model, size, and file paths
- **batches**: Groups related generations for batch processing
- **usage_stats**: Tracks API usage including tokens and costs

## Key Components

### Database Manager

The `DatabaseManager` class in `utils/database_manager.py` provides:

- Database connection and initialization
- Table creation and schema management
- CRUD operations for all database entities
- Transaction management
- Error handling and logging

### Data Models

The `utils/data_models.py` module implements classes for:

- `Prompt`: Represents user prompts with metadata
- `TemplateVariable`: Stores variables for dynamic prompt generation
- `Generation`: Contains details about generated images
- `Batch`: Groups related generations
- `UsageStats`: Tracks API consumption metrics

Each model provides methods for:
- Converting between database records and Python objects
- Validating data integrity
- Formatting for display or export

### History UI

The application now includes UI components for:

- Viewing prompt history
- Searching and filtering prompts
- Reusing previous prompts
- Marking favorite prompts
- Viewing generation history with thumbnails
- Accessing usage statistics

## Integration with Existing Functionality

The database functionality is integrated with:

- Image generation process to record prompts and generations
- UI components for history display and interaction
- Usage tracking for monitoring API consumption
- Error handling for database operations

## Verification

The Phase 3 implementation can be verified using:

```bash
python -m verification.verify_phase3
```

This script checks:
- Database creation and initialization
- Data model functionality
- CRUD operations for all entities
- UI integration for history display
- Usage statistics tracking

## Next Steps

With the database implementation complete in Phase 3, the application is ready for:

- Advanced prompt management and templating (Phase 4)
- Batch processing capabilities
- Export and import functionality
- Analytics and reporting features
