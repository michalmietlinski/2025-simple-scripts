# Phase 1 Verification Guide

This document provides instructions for manually verifying the completion of Phase 1: Project Setup and Basic Structure.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Required packages: `openai`, `python-dotenv`, `tkinter`

## Verification Steps

### 1. Project Structure Verification

Confirm that the following directories and files exist:

- Directories:
  - `utils/` - Utility modules
  - `outputs/` - For storing generated images
  - `data/` - For database and other data files

- Files:
  - `app.py` - Main application
  - `config.py` - Configuration settings
  - `utils/__init__.py` - Package initialization
  - `utils/openai_client.py` - OpenAI API wrapper
  - `utils/file_manager.py` - File management utilities
  - `utils/usage_tracker.py` - Usage tracking functionality
  - `verify_phase1.py` - Verification script

### 2. Configuration Verification

Open `config.py` and verify:
- It contains `APP_CONFIG` with settings for directories, defaults, etc.
- It contains `OPENAI_CONFIG` with API settings
- It has an `ensure_directories()` function to create necessary folders

### 3. API Key Management Verification

Test the API key management:
- Run `python app.py` - it should either load an existing API key or prompt for one
- If prompted, enter a test key to verify it saves correctly
- Check that a `.env` file is created with the key

### 4. Utility Modules Verification

Examine each utility module:

- `openai_client.py`:
  - Contains `OpenAIClient` class
  - Has initialization with API key validation
  - Includes error handling

- `file_manager.py`:
  - Contains `FileManager` class
  - Has methods for directory creation
  - Includes filename generation logic
  - Has image saving functionality

- `usage_tracker.py`:
  - Contains `UsageTracker` class
  - Has database initialization
  - Includes methods to record and retrieve usage

### 5. Automated Verification

Run the verification script: 

```bash
# First install required packages
pip install --user python-dotenv
python -m pip install --user --upgrade pip  # Make sure pip is up to date
pip install --user openai==0.28.1  # Use a specific older version that has fewer dependencies

# Then run the verification script
python verify_phase1.py
