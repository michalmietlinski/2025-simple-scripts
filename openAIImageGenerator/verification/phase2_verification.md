# Phase 2 Verification Guide

This document provides instructions for verifying the completion of Phase 2: Core OpenAI Integration.

## Prerequisites
- Python 3.8+ installed
- Required packages: `openai`, `python-dotenv`, `tkinter`, `pillow`
- Valid OpenAI API key with DALL-E access

## Installation
Before running verification, ensure you have all required packages:

```bash
# Install required packages
pip install --user python-dotenv pillow
pip install --user openai==0.28.1  # Use a specific older version if needed
```

## Verification Steps

### 1. OpenAI Client Verification

Verify that the OpenAI client wrapper has been properly implemented:

- Check that `utils/openai_client.py` contains:
  - `generate_image()` method for creating images from prompts
  - `generate_image_variation()` method for creating variations of existing images
  - Support for different image sizes, qualities, and styles
  - Proper error handling and logging
  - Token usage estimation

### 2. Image Generation Testing

Test the image generation functionality:

```bash
# Run the test script with a prompt
python test_image_generation.py "A beautiful sunset over mountains"

# Optionally specify image size
python test_image_generation.py "A cat wearing sunglasses" 512x512
```

Verify that:
- The image is generated successfully
- The image is saved to the correct directory
- Usage information is recorded in the database

### 3. UI Integration Verification

Verify that the application UI has been updated:

1. Run the application: `python app.py`
2. Check that the UI includes:
   - Prompt input area
   - Image size, quality, and style selectors
   - Generate button
   - Image preview area
   - Save button
3. Test image generation through the UI
4. Verify that generated images can be saved

### 4. Automated Verification

Run the automated verification script:

```bash
python verification/verify_phase2.py
```

This script will:
- Verify the OpenAI client implementation
- Check that all required UI components are present
- Optionally test actual image generation (requires API key)

All checks should pass with a "âœ… All Phase 2 verification checks passed!" message.

### 5. Error Handling Verification

Test error handling by:
1. Temporarily invalidating your API key
2. Attempting to generate an image
3. Verifying that appropriate error messages are displayed

## Troubleshooting

If verification fails:

1. **API key issues**: Ensure your OpenAI API key is valid and has DALL-E access
2. **Import errors**: Check for missing dependencies
3. **UI errors**: Verify that all UI components are properly initialized
4. **Image generation failures**: Check logs for detailed error messages

## Next Steps

Once all verification steps pass, you can proceed to Phase 3: Database Implementation.
