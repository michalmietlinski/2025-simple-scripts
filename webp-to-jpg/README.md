# WebP to JPG Converter

This project provides two different solutions for converting WebP images to JPG format:

1. **Browser Solution**: A simple web-based converter that runs entirely in your browser
2. **Node.js Solution**: A command-line tool that watches a directory for WebP files and automatically converts them

Choose the solution that best fits your needs:
- Use the browser solution for quick, one-off conversions
- Use the Node.js solution for batch processing or automation
